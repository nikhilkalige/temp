This is a static website. Static pages were generated using [Pelican - a python based static site generator](http://blog.getpelican.com/). The site is responsive and makes use of [Zurb Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to achieve the same. The site is currently hosted on Github. I'm using Terminal Dosis, Merriweather fonts served by Google.


The complete site was coded using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [Emmet](http://emmet.io) which makes life a lot easier. The complete source is hosted on [Github](http://github.com/nikhilkalige/techdroid). Feel free to tinker with it.
